# Reads and sample info
This folder contains:
  1) raw mapped read counts from HTSeq for all identified genes for each sample
  2) normalized read counts generated using DESeq2 for all identified genes for each sample
  3) sample information regarding disease group, tissue source, age, sex, and self-identified race/ethnicity
  4) differential gene expression analysis with median reads and between-group statistical analysis for the filtered gene list for the disease groups and for the HFpEF subgroups
  
  We have not provided the raw sequence data (FASTQ format) because they contain potentially identifiable information for the patients.
  
  We have not provided other covariate information because they represent active areas of research in our group.
